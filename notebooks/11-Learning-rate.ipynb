    "When examining [learning rate](https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#sanitycheck) graphs, several distinct patterns emerge that provide valuable insights into model training dynamics: \n",
    "- **Very high learning rate** (yellow curve) typically produces diverging loss that increases over time, indicating unstable optimisation where parameter updates overshoot minima and potentially cause numerical instability.\n",
    "- **High learning rates** (green curve) show rapid initial progress followed by oscillation or plateauing, suggesting the model approaches optimal regions quickly but lacks the precision to settle properly, bouncing around like a ball with too much energy.\n",
    "- **Good learning rates** (red curve) display steady, consistent decreases that eventually flatten at low values, representing an ideal balance between speed and stability that allows the model to converge efficiently.\n",
    "- **Low learning rates** (blue curve) produce very slow, almost linear decreases in loss, indicating cautious parameter updates that never overshoot but require significantly more computational resources and training time."
