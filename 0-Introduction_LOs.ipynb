    "You should be comfortable programming in Python. Experience with the content of our [Applied Data Analysis in Python course](https://bristol-training.github.io/applied-data-analysis-in-python/) or equivalent is strongly recommended. This covers:\n",

    "- Working with dataframes/numpy arrays\n",
    "- Plotting with matplotlib/seaborn\n",

    "- Using classes such as sklearn models\n",
    "- Test train split and validating models\n",

    "- Understand the basic theory of a feed forward multi layer perceptron.\n",
    "- Start to get the grips with PyTorch, tensors and writing classes in Python.\n",
    "- Understand how to pre-process data for training (including test train split)\n",
    "- Understand how to feed forward data and evaluate test loss for a neural network.\n",
    "- Have a basic intuition for what gradient descent and back propagation are.\n",
    "- Implement back propagation to update our weights and biases and reduce our test loss."
