    "- Understand the basic theory of a feed forward multi layer perceptron.\n",
    "- Start to get the grips with PyTorch, tensors and classes in Python.\n",
    "- Understand how to pre-process data for training (including test train split)\n",
    "- Understand how to feed forward data and evaluate test loss for a neural network.\n",
    "- Have a basic intuition for what gradient descent and back propogation are.\n",
    "- Implement back propogation to update our weights and biases and reduce our test loss.\n",
