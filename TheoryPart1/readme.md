Theory: 

1. Historical context (brief): Perceptron and the decision boundary (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-9ALe3U-Fg) (Boyi)
Finish with "why the perceptron alone isn't enough"
2. Why you need Activation functions (mention ReLu and Sigmoid, allude to others), something about bending a decision boundary around points (Huw)
3. Multilayer perceptron (what does this do, roughly what happens when you input numbers and know your weights and biases) (Probably Huw too!)
