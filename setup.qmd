# Run the code on your own machine

To follow along on your own machine, follow these instructions:

1. **Open a terminal** (or Git Bash)

    _Windows users:_ We recommend that you install Git and Git Bash, unless you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
    You should be able to do this by running the following command in command prompt or Powershell:

    ```bash
    winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget 
    ```

    If this doesn't work, then [follow the instructions on the Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).

2. **Install `uv`** by running:

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Close and re-open your terminal, if the installer requests this.

    If you already have `uv` installed, then upgrade to the latest version before continuing by running `uv self update`, or by upgrading through whatever means you used to install `uv` originally (for example, Homebrew users would run `brew upgrade uv`).

3. **Download the course content**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bristol-Training/intro-to-ai
    cd course
    ```

4. **Check your PyTorch version**:

    ```bash
    uv run python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
    ```

    This command will automatically download the version of Python and all the Python libraries that are required for the course.

5. **Run Jupyter Lab**:

    ```bash
    uv run jupyter lab notebooks
    ```

    In future, just re-run this command to get access to the course again.
